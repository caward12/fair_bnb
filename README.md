## Overview

The goal of this project was to 'clone' the base functionality of Airbnb.

### Setup

To set up a local copy of this project, perform the following:

run `Bundle`

run `rake db:reset`

run `bundle exec figaro install` & add keys to `config/application.yml`:
```  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: <KEY>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: <SECRET_KEY>
FACEBOOK_KEY: <KEY>
FACEBOOK_SECRET: <SECRET_KEY>
GOOGLE_MAP_KEY: <KEY>
WEATHER_KEY: <KEY>
test:
  GOOGLE_USER_TOKEN:
  FACEBOOK_USER_TOKEN:
```
**Internal API**

The following api endpoints are available:

*For users*

`/api/v1/users/money/most_revenue` lists users who have made the most money as property owners based on reservation income. Can take a `limit` param, default is 10 users.

`/api/v1/users/money/most_spent` lists users who have spent the most money on reservations. Can take a `limit` param, default is 10.

`/api/v1/users/properties/most_properties` lists users who have the most properties listed that they are the owner of. Can take a `limit` param, default is 10.

*For reservations*

### Design
* We used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to style our website.

### Test Suite

* The test suite tests the application on multiple levels. To run all of the tests, run `rspec` from the terminal in the main directory of the project. The feature tests (integration tests) rely mainly on the [capybara gem](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) for navigating the various application views.

### Dependencies

* This application depends on many ruby gems, all of which are found in the `Gemfile` and can be installed by running `bundle install` from the terminal in the main directory of the project.
